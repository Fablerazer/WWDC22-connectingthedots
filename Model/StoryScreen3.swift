//    I was always bad at drawing, but i didn't know where to start learning

//  Let's start with something simple, starring the .....
//  Imagine cutting up the bottle into simple shapes

    // and all of that causing me to absorb a lot of negative energy back then
    // It's dark and empty, i feel hopeless, I'm asking to myself, `why i should live in this world? what is my purpose?`
    //  And i'm not alone, not too long ago my best friend opened up to me about his deepest fear and a lot of his friends and my other friends who had the same problem that i had went through in the past
    //  Because i know what it feels when having that exact kind of problem, I wanna help them to rise up! and persuade them be the best version of themselves
    //
    //  First of all we have to start from the past
    
    //  why can we be the person we are today?, what is the causality?, and how we can improve what we have within us and boost it to our own benefit

    //  and also this method is used by founder of Apple `Steve Jobs`\n\nIt's called `connecting the dots`
    
    //  but before that i want you to do a minigames that's literally about connecting the dots ðŸ˜…
    
    
    
    
    // ''You have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future, because believing that the dots will connect down the road, will give you the confidence to follow your heart. Even when it leads you off the worn path, and that will make all the difference''
    
    //  From 3 of the most focused thing that i grind about, one of them is about design and i want to give you the example and share with you how i cope with this problem
    
    // ''You can't connect the dots by looking forward, you can only connect them by looking backwards''
    //
    //  To summ it up
    //  Know that we all have challenges, and knowing that they only makes us stronger
    //  To connecting the dots is needing a combination between embracing our past, determination and future vision, do that and trust everything will work out perfectly in the end
